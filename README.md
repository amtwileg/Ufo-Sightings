# UFO Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the data through filtering on different attributes such as date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
This webpaged is best used by using the new search feature. You will find five different search filters on the webpage. These are:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape

The table data can be filtered by changing any or all of these filters. If you wish to remove a filter, simply delete all the text in the input box. Give it a try!

## Summary
One drawback of this new design is that one cannot filter with the logical OR, only the logical AND.
Recommendations for further development:
1. Paginate the table: There is far too much table data when no filters are applied. Noone wants to scroll that far down.
2. Add each filter to the associated table column header. This is a more intuitive design for users who are used to tables in Excel.
